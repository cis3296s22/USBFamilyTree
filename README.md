# USB Family Tree

This project will use JavaFX to create a mutable graph that will act as the basis for a family tree. The USB portion of this project is part of the idea that the program will be written such that the executable file can be run from an USB drive thatâ€™s plugged into a computer installed with a JDK. What this means is that all the data that the program progressively stores as the users add more information to their family tree is saved onto the USB drive and accessed by the executable file within the USB drive. The end goal is that a USB drive can be passed down through the generations, and if the drive gets too large, all of the files can be transferred to a new drive with more memory.

### How to build
To run this program, download all of the contents of the github repository. Within the github repo will be a file called `run.bat`. The contents of `run.bat` will be `java -jar main.jar` in one line, and double clicking `run.bat` will make the jar file run.
